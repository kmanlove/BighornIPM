Bighorn Demographic Analysis
==========

This repository contains all code and documentation for K. Manlove's analysis of bighorn sheep population demography in the presence and absence of pneumonia. Since data for this project are currently unpublished, they are not shared here; for data-related questions please contact K. Manlove (kezia <dot> manlove <at> gmail). 

Structure
---------

The project consists of the follow components:

--------
1. A conceptual comparison of diseases with negative and positive autocorrelations, and how this maps to host vital rates when vital rates are tied to disease presence. 

2. An empirical examination of autocorrelation patterns in disease status among Hells Canyon bighorn sheep.

3. A simulation study of disease persistence at varying host recovery rates.

4. An integrative population model estimating bighorn vital rates in the Hells Canyon system under two definitions of age structure.

5. A matrix model comparison of equilibrium bighorn population dynamics in the presence and absence of disease.

6. A simulation study with Markovian transitions between host disease states through time.
